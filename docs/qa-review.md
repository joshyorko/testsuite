# testsuite QA review

Coverage snapshot and known gaps live in `docs/skills/test-authoring/suite-map/SKILL.md`. Read that file for the current per-suite matrix and `@future` stub list rather than duplicating counts here.

The current branch's mechanical recount is 471 scenarios across 61 feature files;
the five active sudo-rs scenarios are included in the smoke total there.

## What this repo is responsible for

- Behave suite coverage and quality
- qecore + dogtail integration patterns
- Shared step/harness reuse across suites
- Reliable scenario-level validation logic

What it is **not** responsible for: lab hardware ops, ArgoCD, persistent titan VM lifecycle → `testing-lab`.

## uupd conditional suppression coverage

Issue #503 is blocked on a cross-repo contract. uupd checks battery state via
UPower (`OnBattery`, DisplayDevice `Percentage`, and the active power profile)
and metered networking via NetworkManager's `Metered` property. testsuite
cannot safely fake or restore those system-bus properties in the current VM
contract; writing `/sys/class/power_supply` or changing GNOME proxy settings
would test the wrong interfaces and could leak state between scenarios.

Keep the existing uupd binary/timer health check active. The proposed next step
is for the image or lab owner to provide an isolated simulation hook, after
which testsuite can add behavior coverage against `/etc/uupd/config.json` and
the upstream uupd check semantics.

## Highest-risk test correctness areas

1. GNOME Shell 50+ top-bar AT-SPI gaps (must use `Shell.Eval` fallback where needed)
2. dogtail API misuse (`requireResult` on `findChild`) causing runtime errors
3. Step-definition collisions in suites where multiple step files are loaded
4. Duplicated SSH logic instead of shared helper reuse

## Review gate for testsuite PRs

1. Are new scenarios added in the correct suite?
2. Are shared helpers reused where applicable?
3. Are step phrases unique within each loaded suite?
4. Is dogtail usage compatible with the current API behavior?
5. Do docs (`README.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, `docs/skills/`) still match behavior?
6. Are new scenario tests added as behave steps, with pytest reserved for `tests/unit/` helper coverage?
7. If scenario counts changed, are `docs/skills/test-authoring/suite-map/SKILL.md` and feature-file totals updated?

## Unit test coverage

Run unit tests with `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/ -q`. The `pytest` CI check (`unit-tests.yml`) runs on every PR and merge queue entry.

## Current stub posture

- `flatcar/lifecycle`: partially active — knuckle install, update channel, and afterburn implemented; boot-order swap, Ignition config-drive, and `update_strategy=off` remain `@future`.
- `security/selinux`: all scenarios active (cosign verification across image variants).
- `nvidia`: still `@future` / `@hardware_blocked` until GPU passthrough exists in the lab.
- `kde-smoke`: 13 `@informational` scenarios in one feature file (repo totals: 479 scenarios / 61 feature files by mechanical recount; see the count-drift notice in `suite-map/SKILL.md`); Aurora-only Phase-2 harness proof. The shared KDE helpers and `e2e.yml` suite registration it depends on landed in #641-#645.
